<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I've always been fascinated by typing games, they are essential for any developer in my opinion. So I decided to make my own JavaScript typing game.
I used a little bit of HTML and a little bit of CSS to style it up and make my design look pretty, but I focused more on the JavaScript part, which is where I make my design work.
I used several functions to generate random phrases and change the project's theme to a light or dark one, all of which I had already done and seen in my past projects, such as my dashboard and calculator, where I implemented the function to change the theme . And my name generator project, where I implemented the function to generate and display random names.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can learn more things and functions in JavaScript, also to improve my coding skills by doing something i like to do.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>The user has to correctly write the text displayed at the top, once the user has finished writing the text, the time in seconds that the user took will appear at the bottom, as well as a table of the time that the user took a while to write the other sentences. At the top there is also a button to change the theme to a darker or lighter one.</p>
